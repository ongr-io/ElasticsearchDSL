# How to search with Elasticsearch DSL

In this chapter we will take a look how to perform a search via objective way with Elasticsearch DSL. Well, the good news is that is very simple. That's why we created this library ;).

To start a search you have to create a `Search` object.

```php
$search = new Search();
```

> We won't include namespaces in any examples. Don't worry all class's names are unique, so any IDE editor should autocomplete and include it for you ;).

So, when we have a `Search` object we can start add something to it. Usually you will add `Query`, `Filter` and `Aggregation`.

> More info how create [queries](../Query/index.md) and [aggregations](../Aggregation/index.md) objects.

### Form a Query

Lets take a simple query example with `MatchAllQuery`.

```php
$matchAllQuery = new MatchAllQuery();
```

To add query to the `Search` simply call `addQuery` function.

```php
$search->addQuery($matchAllQuery);
```

At the end it will form this query:

```JSON
{
  "query": {
      "match_all": {}
  }
}
```


> There is no limits to add queries or filters or anything.

### Form a Filter

Since Elasticsearch 2.0 all filters were replaced by queries. Queries acts like
filters when you use them in filter context.

To add a filter is the same way like a query. First, lets create some `Filter` object.

```php
$matchAllQuery = new MatchAllQuery();
```

And simply add to the `Search`:

```php
$search->addFilter($matchAllQuery);
```

Unlike `Query`, when we add a `Filter` with our DSL library it will add a query and all necessary stuff for you. So when we add one filter we will get this query:

```JSON
{
  "query": {
      "bool": {
          "filter": {
              "match_all": {}
          }
      }
  }
}
```

### Multiple queries and filters

As you know there is possible to use multiple filters and queries in elasticsearch. No problem, if you have several filters just add it to the search. `ElasticsearchDSL` will form a `Bool` query or filter for you when you add more than one.

Lets take an example with `Query`:

```php
$search = new Search();
$termQueryForTag1 = new TermQuery("tag", "wow");
$termQueryForTag2 = new TermQuery("tag", "elasticsearch");
$termQueryForTag3 = new TermQuery("tag", "dsl");

$search->addQuery($termQueryForTag1);
$search->addQuery($termQueryForTag2);
$search->addQuery($termQueryForTag3, BoolQuery::SHOULD);
```
The query will look like:

```JSON
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
        "must": [
            {
                "term": { "tag": "wow" }
            },
            {
                "term": { "tag": "elasticsearch" }
            }
        ]
        "should": [
            {
                "term": { "tag": "dsl" }
            }
        ]
    }
  }
}
```
> More info how to form bool queries find in [Bool Query](../Query/Bool.md) chapter.

The same way it works with a `Filter`. Take a look at this example:

```php
$search = new Search();
$termQuery = new TermQuery('name', 'ongr');
$existsQuery = new ExistsQuery('tag');
$search->addQuery($termFilter);
$search->addQuery($existsFilter, BoolQuery::MUST_NOT);
```

Elasticsearch DSL will form this query:

```JSON
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
        "must": [
            {
                "term": {
                    "name": "ongr"
                }
            }
        ],
        "must_not": [
            {
                "exists": {
                    "field": "tag"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Modify queries

### Sent request to the elasticsearch
And finally we can pass it to `elasticsearch-php` client. To generate an array for the client call `toArray()` function.

```php
//from elasticsearch/elasticsearch package
$client = ClientBuilder::create()->build();

$searchParams = [
  'index' => 'people',
  'type' => 'person',
  'body' => $search->toArray(),
];

$docs = $client->search($searchParams);
```

> This example is for elasticsearch/elasticsearch ~5.0 version.
