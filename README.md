# ElasticsearchDSL

Introducing Elasticsearch DSL library to provide objective query builder for [Elasticsearch bundle](https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchBundle) and [elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) client. You can easily build any Elasticsearch query and transform it to an array.

## Documentation

[The online documentation of the bundle is here](docs/index.md)

## Try it!

### Installation

Install library with [composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
$ composer require ongr/elasticsearch-dsl
```

> [elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) client is defined in the composer requirements, no need to install it.

### Search

Elasticsearch DSL was extracted from [Elasticsearch Bundle](https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchBundle) to provide standalone query dsl for [elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php). Examples how to use it together with [Elasticsearch Bundle](https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchBundle) can be found in the [Elasticsearch Bundle docs](https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/search.md).

If you dont want to use Symfony or Elasticsearch bundle, no worries, you can use it in any project together with [elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php). Here's the example:

If you are using Symfony there is also the [ElasticsearchBundle](https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchBundle)
which provides full integration with Elasticsearch DSL.

The library is standalone and is not coupled with any framework. You can use it in any PHP project, the only
requirement is composer.  Here's the example:

Create search:

```php
 <?php
  require 'vendor/autoload.php'; //Composer autoload

  $client = ClientBuilder::create()->build(); //elasticsearch-php client
  
  $matchAll = new ONGR\ElasticsearchDSL\Query\MatchAllQuery();
  
  $search = new ONGR\ElasticsearchDSL\Search();
  $search->addQuery($matchAll);
  
  $params = [
    'index' => 'your_index',
    'body' => $search->toArray(),
  ];
  
  $results = $client->search($params);
```

Elasticsearch DSL covers every elasticsearch query, all examples can be found in [the documentation](docs/index.md)
